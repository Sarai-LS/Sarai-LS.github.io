# **Overview**
This threat brief analyzes **CVE-2024-12987**, a critical OS command-injection vulnerability affecting **DrayTek Vigor2960, Vigor300B, and Vigor3900 routers** running firmware version **1.5.1.4**. The vulnerability exists within the router's Web Management interface and allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary system commands with **root privileges**.

Due to its remote, unauthenticated nature and confirmed exploitation in the wild, this vulnerability presents a severe risk to exposed network infrastructure.

# **Executive Summary**
- **Vulnerability:** CVE-2024-12987
- **Affected Products:** DrayTek Vigor2960, Vigor300B, Vigor3900 routers
- **Impact:** Remote OS command execution with root privileges
- **Severity:** Critical (remote, unauthenticated)
- **Exploitation Status:** Listed in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog (May 2025)

Unpatched devices are at high risk of full compromise, persistent access, and potential lateral movement within internal networks.

# **Situation Overview**
CVE-2024-12987 is an OS command-injection vulnerability in the **Web Management interface** of affected DrayTek routers. The flaw resides in the endpoint:

```terminal
/cgi-bin/mainfunciton.cgi/apmcfgupload
```
Improper sanitization of the ```session``` parameter allows unauthenticated attackers to inject and execute arbitrary system commands with root-level privileges.

The vulnerability was disclosed on **December 27, 2024**, with a public proof-of-concept (PoC) released shortly thereafter. Subsequent reporting confirmed exploitation via **botnet campaigns**, and the vulnerability was added to **CISA's KEV Catalog on May 15, 2025**, confirming active exploitation in the wild.

# **Vendor Response & Remediation**
DrayTek has released **firmware version 1.5.1.5** for all affected models to address CVE-2024-12987 by correcting the input-sanitization flaw.

The vendor recommends:
- Immediate firmware upgrades
- Restricting or disabling external access to the Web Management interface
- Monitoring for abnormal outbound traffic or signs of prior compromise

# **Recommended Actions for Organizations**
Organizations using affected DrayTek Vigor routers should take the following steps:
- **Upgrade firmware immediately** to version 1.5.1.5 or later
- **Restrict or disable Web Management access** until systems are fully patched
- **Monitor logs and network traffic** for requests to ```/cgi-bin/mainfunciton.cgi/apmcfgupload``` and other anomalous activity
- **Limit management access to trusted networks only**
- **Use CISA's KEV Catalog** to prioritize remediation of actively exploited vulnerabilities
