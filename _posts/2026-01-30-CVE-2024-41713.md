# **Overview**
This threat brief analyzes CVE-2024-41713, a path traversal vulnerability affecting the **NuPoint Unified Messaging (NPM)** component of **Mitel MiCollab**. The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive system files and configuration data.

Due to its remote, unauthenticated exploitatbility and critical severity, this vulnerability presents a significant risk to exposed MiCollab deployments.

# **Executive Summary**
- **Vulnerability:** CVE-2024-41713
- **Affected Product:** Mitel MiCollab (NuPoint Unified Messaging component)
- **Impact:** Unauthorized file access, data corruption, and potential administrative compromist
- **Severity:** Critical (CVSS 9.1)
- **Exlpoitation Status:** Listed in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog (January 2025)

Unpatched systems are at high risk compromise due to the vulnerability's remote and unauthenticated nature.

# **Situation Overview**
CVE-2024-41713 is a path traversal vulnerability in **Mitel MiCollab**, affecting versions **9.8 SP1 FP2 and earlier**. The flaw allows attackers to manipulate file paths and gain unauthorized access to sensitive system files and configuration data.

According to Mitel Advisories, successful exploitation may allow attackers to:
- Read, modify, or delete user data
- Corrupt system configurations
- Perform unauthorized administrative actions

The vulnerability's inclusion in **CISA's KEV Catalog** confirms active exploitation in teh wild and elevates its remediation priority.

# **Vendor Response & Remidiation**
Mitel has released an official security advisory, **MISA-2024-0029**, detailing mitigations and remediation guidance.

The vulnerability has been fully addresed in:
- **Mitel MiCollab verstion 9.8 SP2 and later**

# **Recommended Actions for Organizations**
Organizations using Mitel MiCollab should take the following steps to reduce exposure:
- **Identify and upgrade affected systems** running version 9.8 SP1 FP2 or earlier to 9.8 SP2 or newer
- **Monitor logs and system activity** for indicators of compromise or abnormal behavior
- **Review firewall rules and access controls** to limit external exposure of MiCollab services
- **Use CISA KEV guidance** to prioritize remediation of actively exploited vulnerabilities
