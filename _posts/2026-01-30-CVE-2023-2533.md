# **Overview**
This threat brief analyzes **CVE-2023-2533**, a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability affecting **PaperCut NG/MF**. The vulnerability can be abused to coerce an authenticated administrator into performing privileged actions, including modifying security settings and, under certain conditions, achieving remote code execution.

While exploitation requires an active administrator session and social engineering, confirmed exploitation activity and includion in **CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog** elevate the overall risk.

# **Executive Summary**
- **Vulnerability:** CVE-2023-2533
- **Affected Product:** PaperCut NG/MF
- **Impact:** Unauthorized privileged actions and potential remote code execution
- **Severity:** Moderate-High (varies by source)
- **Exploitation Status:** Listed in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalot (July 2025)

Organizations running unpatched PaperCut instances face increased risk, particularly where administrative interfaces are exposed or users are susceptible to social engineering.

# **Situation Overview**
CVE-2023-2533 is a CSRF vulnerability affecting specific versions of **PaperCut NG/MF**, including **version 22.0.10 (Build 65996)**. The flaw allows attackers to craft malicious requests that, when executed by an authenticated administrator, can result in unauthorized configuration changes.

Under certain conditions, successful exploitation may lead to **remote code execution**. Although exploitation requires user interaction, evidence of real-world exploitation emerged following disclosure in **June 2023**, and the vulnerability was added to **CISA's KEV Catalog in July 2025**, confirming active exploitation in the wild.

# **Vendor Response & Remediation**
PaperCut published a security bulletin in **June 2023** addressing CVE-2023-2533 and released patched versions across multiple supported release branches.

Fixed versions include:
- **22.1.x**
- **21.2.12**
- **20.1.8**

The vendor advises customers to upgrade immediately and follow additional hardening guidance outlined in the security bulletin and product documentation.

# **Recommendation Actions for Organizations**
Organizations using PaperCut NG/MF should take the following steps:
- **Patch systems immediately** by upgrading to **PaperCut version 22.1.1 or later**, or the appropriate fixed version for their release branch
- **Restrict administrative interface access** by limiting exposure to trusted networks only
- **Monitor logs and administrative activity** for unusual configuration changes or suspicious requests
- **Verify patch deployment** by confirming all PaperCut servers are running updated, fixed versions
