# Overview
This post documents my hands-on cybersecurity training through **TryHackMe**, an interactive learning platform focused on real-world security concepts and practical labs.

To date, I have completed **42 rooms** covering network fundamentals, Linux and Windows systems, web application security, crypography, and penetration testing methodologies. These labs have helped me build both technical skills and a security-focused mindset through guided exercises and challenge-based learning.

## 🏅 Badges and Achievements

## 🔍 Selected Room Highlights

### Linux Privilege Escalation
Focused on enumeration techniques, misconfigured permissions, SUID (Set User ID) binaries, cron jobs, and exploiting vulnerable services to escalate privileges on Linux systems.

### Windows Privilege Escalation
Explored common Windows privilege escalation scenarios including service misconfiguration, registry abuse, and credential harvesting techniques.

### Burp Suite: The Basics
Learned how to intercept, modify, and analyze HTTP requests to identify vulnerabilities such as parameter tampering and insecure input handling.

### Wireshark: Traffic Analysis
Analyzed PCAP files to identify anomaloys network behavior, suspicious traffic patterns, and protocol misuse.

### Metasploit: Exploitation
Use Metasploit modules for scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation to understand real-world attack workflows.

## 🚀 What This Experience Gave Me
Completing these labs strengthened my understanding of how real-world systems are attacked and defended. Beyond individual tools, I learned how to methodically think about enumeration, exploitation, and post-exploitatino while maintaining an ethical and responsible approach to security.

This hands-on experience has reinforced my interest in cybersecurity and prepared me for continued learning in defensive and offensive security roles.
